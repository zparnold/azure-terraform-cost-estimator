# Terraform Cost Estimator

Helps you to estimate costs of Terraform Plans and right now is focused on the [`azurerm`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) 
Terraform Provider. _Note these are **estimates only** (not actual costs)
based on "Pay-as-you-Go" pricing. The point of this API is only so you have an estimate, not a guarantee of potential future costs._ 
If you're looking for other pricing schemes, such as "reserved", "DevTest", or if your company has an agreement
with a cloud provider that gives you a discount off of standard "Pay-as-you-Go" list prices this will not be reflected here. Hopefully,
if you are looking for one of these pricing schemes, this API should at least provide you with an upper-bound. However,
it in no way represents a guarantee of prices between you and your cloud provider.

### Can I use this for more cloud providers than Azure?
It is definitely designed to provide this functionality, but at present since I work at a company that uses Azure I'm
focused on that. That being said, PR's welcome!

## Usage
**One more time for emphasis, this is only an estimate of expected future cloud costs!**
```bash
terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan > /dev/null && terraform show -json plan.tfplan  | curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- https://api-dev.pricing.tf/estimate
```
### Response
```json
{
    "unsupported_resources": [
        "azurerm_network_interface.example"
    ],
    "unestimateable_resources": [
        "azurerm_resource_group.example",
        "azurerm_subnet.example",
        "azurerm_virtual_network.example"
    ],
    "estimate_summary": {
        "hourly_cost_usd": 0.114,
        "monthly_cost_usd": 83.22,
        "yearly_cost_usd": 998.64
    }
}
```
The response provides:
* `unsupported_resources` to let you know which resources weren't priced
* `estimate_summary` which contains the Hourly, Monthly, and Yearly additional cost based on this Terraform plan
* `unestimateable_resources` to let you know which resources are not currently able to be estimated based on this terraform plan

_Note: currently "monthly" and "yearly" prices are only calculated as a multiple of hours. 1 Month = 730 Hours and 1 Year = 8760 Hours._

## Security
The code is all here and executes in a serverless function, you can read for yourself and see that we're not storing/logging anything
you send. :smile:

#### A side note on billable units of measure:
Not all billable resources in Azure are tied to an hourly price. For example, consider VNETs/egress, StorageAccount Blob Storage consumed size,
or anything tied to API call count like KeyVault. These resources depend on further consumption after provisioning, so they
are in-effect unestimateable from the standpoint of this API. In theory, one could derive an estimate based on average consumption across all Azure usage,
but I don't work for Microsoft/nor have access to that data. So, they will probably remain unestimated unless you have a 
good idea and want to contribute!

## To Dev
* Ensure that go >= 1.13 and `serverless` 2.x is installed on your machine
* Make a PR (add a test too)
* Assign me (zparnold) and I will try to get it merged and deployed.

## Adding Resources to Price
The `api/pricers/` folder is where a collection of interfaces of type `Pricer` are implemented. The only function necessary to
implement this interface is `GetHourlyPrice()` which returns a `float64`. Should you want to use the existing price database (Dynamo)
take a look at the resource enumeration section below. There is also a `prices.csv` that should give you a full list of 
priceable objects in Azure returned by their public API here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices

To add another resource to be priced:

* Add a new file, preferably in the `api/pricers/` folder using a name that would help others understand it
* Implement the function from above
* Add a `case` statement in the `api/main.go` which binds the terraform resource name to the pricer (copy one from the method.)
